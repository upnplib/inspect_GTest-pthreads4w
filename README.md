# inspect_GTest-pthreads4w
Inspect how GoogleTest works with POSIX Threads for Windows.

GoogleTest finds the pthread header and library but unfortunately does not compile successfully. I haven't found why not yet. I will keep looking for a solution. **UPnPlib** and other programs can compile and use pthreads but testing and mocking pthread functions does not work. All other tests are working. To make this repository running just don't modify environment variable LIB but CL is needed as shown below. GoogleTest will not find the pthreads libraries then and compiles successful without pthread support. Then you can check the simple program with pthreads.

## Preparation
Here I use the PowerShell. These are examples from my environment. You have to use your own correct paths to your installation.

We have to set some environment variables to find the libraries. We cannot do it with cmake because there they are only local to the current process. They are not propagated to sub- and calling processes. We have to set them before executing cmake.

To find the header files of pthreads4w we must set the environment varilable CL:

    PS> $env:CL = "/I C:\Users\ingo\devel\inspect_GTest-pthreads4w\build\_deps\pthreads4w-src"

To find the linkable libraries we have to append its directories to the LIB environment variable. To easy restore the original setting I backup it:

    PS> $env:LIB_orig = $env:LIB
    PS> $env:LIB += ";C:\Users\ingo\devel\inspect_GTest-pthreads4w\build\_deps\pthreads4w-build"

To find the .dll files we have to append its directory to the Path environment variable. To easy restore the original setting I backup it. These settings are not needed if you link with the static pthreads4w library.

    PS> $env:Path_orig = $env:Path
    # for googletest executable (.dll)
    PS> $env:Path += ";C:\Users\ingo\devel\inspect_GTest-pthreads4w\build\_deps\pthreads4w-build"

## Configuration and build

    PS> cmake -S . -B build -G "NMake Makefiles" --log-level=DEBUG -D BUILD_TESTING=OFF -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel [-D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON] [-D GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1]
    PS> cmake --build build --config MinSizeRel
    PS> .\gtests\build\test_template.exe
    PS> .\gtests\build\simple_pthread.exe

Option `-D GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` is usually not needed if all environment variables are set.

## Conclusion
It seems GoogleTest with pthreads is quite buggy in particular on Microsoft Windows. Because I want cross platform compatibillity of the Unit Tests I decided to use GoogleTest without pthreads on all platforms. This is no problem on MS Windows because pthreads are not available there by default. GoogleTest compiles successful without pthread support on MS Windows. On Linux it is a problem to disable pthreads because GoogleTest finds it always from the standard operating system and connot be disabled. There is a flag `-D GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=0` but it doesn't work as expected. See below. Lack of pthread support with GoogleTest does not affect pthreads on built programs. On the contrary, it enables mocking of pthread functions, which otherwise would crash with segfault. In particular I have found:

- GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD does not work as expected
- GoogleTest does not compile successful pthreads4w with Generator "NMake Makefiles"
- GoogleTest does not find library of pthreads4w with Generator "Visual Studio *"
- Preprocessor macro 'GTEST_IS_THREADSAFE' does not work
